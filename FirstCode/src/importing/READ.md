# Importing Package

This folder contains beginner-level Java exercises focused on:

- User input
- Conditional logic
- Mathematical operations
- Use of the `Scanner` class

## Contents

### Exercise1.java
Prompts the user to input their age and determines if they are eligible to vote using an if-else statement.

### Exercise2.java
Asks the user for their full name and a numeric threshold. It then compares the nameâ€™s character length to the threshold and gives feedback.

### Exercise3.java
Calculates the perimeter and area of a square. The side length is input by the user, and calculations use basic arithmetic and `Math.pow()`.

### Exercise4.java
Takes a whole number input from the user and computes its square root using `Math.sqrt()`.

# How to Use

Navigate to this directory, then compile and run a file:

```bash
javac Exercise1.java
java importing.Exercise1
Repeat with Exercise2, Exercise3, or Exercise4 as needed.

Note: Ensure you're in the src folder when compiling if using package names.

# Requirements
Java JDK 8 or newer

Any IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code) or command-line terminal with javac and java

# Topics Covered
Java Scanner input handling

Conditional statements (if, else)

String manipulation and length checking

Mathematical functions (Math.sqrt(), Math.pow())
