# First package

This repository contains beginner-level Java code and small programming examples.

## Contents

Currently available:

- `DataStorage.java` — A sample program for storing and managing simple data.
- `WeatherReportingAgain.java` — Analyzes temperatures and sunshine over 5 days, calculates average temperature, and prints daily/weekly weather statistics.
- `DeclaringAndUsingVars.java` — Simple beginner example of declaring and using variables.
- `HelloWorld.java` — Prints a classic "Hello World" message and a simple ASCII art Christmas tree.
- `IfStatement` — Demonstrates basic variable assignment, arithmetic operations, and a simple `if` condition to check whether a calculated sum exceeds a threshold.
- `LabExercise17Sept.java` — Demonstrates Java `String` manipulation methods (e.g. `.length()`, `.charAt()`, `.toUpperCase()`, `.replace()`, `.indexOf()`) and basic integer division.
- `MakingDecisions.java` — Uses multiple `if` statements to compare two integers and determine which is larger (or if they are equal), demonstrating basic decision-making in Java.
- `ZZRedoWeatherReportingAfterP3.java` — A refined version of the weather reporting program. Initially added for structure and basic functionality, later updated to correct temperature comparisons and improve clarity in output formatting.

> **Note:** A previous version of `HelloWorld.java` was part of an earlier branch (`main`) and is no longer included in the current `master` branch.
